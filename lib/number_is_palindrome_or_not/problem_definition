**Story
A new task has come up in your team. An internal system needs to be able to check whether a number is a palindrome or not.
You have been assigned the task to write the function,
while the senior software engineer Bob wrote the tests.
But when you try to write the function, you can't make it pass the tests as you expect! And worse still,
Bob has gone on holiday! Maybe he slightly changed the meaning of "palindrome" in this task? Can you work out how to make
the function work correctly?

Examples
 585  -->  True
1497  -->  False
 891  -->  True
1001  -->  False
Bob said it should work for really really big numbers.

Good luck!
