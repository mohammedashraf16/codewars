In programming you know the use of the logical negation operator (!),
it reverses the meaning of a condition.

!false = true
!!false = false
Your task is to complete the function 'negationValue()'
that takes a string of negations with a value and returns
what the value would be if those negations were applied to it.

negationValue("!", false); //=> true
negationValue("!!!!!", true); //=> false
